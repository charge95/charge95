## Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
Hello there,  my name is Rich and I am currently studing coding at TechElevator.  
I have studied programing for several years at this point but never with the drive to make something of it.  And as a result I usually end up losing motivation and stop coding for several months.  I am hoping that the stucture of TechElevator will give me the motivation to stick with learning and allow me to start a career in coding.  

I want to be able to make games and develop apps.

In my spare time I tend to read books of various genres mainly Fantasy and Scifi.  Lately though I've been reading Nonfiction stories.
